# The Connotations of News Articles

For this project, we were interested in how media articles are written with the intent of subliminally influencing their readers. More specifiaclly, we wanted to test a machines ability to predict the connotations journalists try to embed onto their article from the get-go in their headers. Our goal was to cultivate a novel dataset that will help us predict the connotation of a news article.

### Making a Dataset

To make the project more interesting and manageable, our team decidede to cultivate a dataset centered around colleges, more specfically Penn. We used the centuries old Penn newspaper, [The Daily Pennsylvanian](https://www.thedp.com/) and their [archive](https://dparchives.library.upenn.edu/?a=cl&cl=CL2&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------) through the Penn library.
